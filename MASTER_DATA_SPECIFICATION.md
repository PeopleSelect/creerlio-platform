## END OF MASTER DATA SPECIFICATION

**USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:**
Copy this entire document into GitHub Codespaces Chat and instruct it to:
1. Generate TypeScript enums for all dropdown categories
2. Create database schema (SQL/Prisma) for storing data
3. Build autocomplete components for each data type
4. Implement search filters using this taxonomy
5. Create seed data files for development/testing
6. Build API endpoints for fetching dropdown data

This specification provides the complete foundation for all dropdowns, filters, search functionality, and data categorization across the entire Crelio platform.
